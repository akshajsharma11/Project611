<h3>IPL 2021, match highlights: Kolkata Knight Riders vs Mumbai Indians</h3> 
<p>Tonight we have Rohit Sharma's Mumbai Indians facing off with Eoin Morgan's Kolkata Knight Riders. We'll have the likes of Hardik Pandya, Jasprit Bumrah and Kieron Pollard against the likes of Shubman Gill, Andre Russell and Dinesh Karthik. If this blog doesn't load for you

Prasidh Krishna is back at a fairly square fine leg for Ishan Kishan, and Pat Cummins produces a good bouncer, tucking up the left-hander in the rib-cage area. He goes for the hook, picks out the fielder on the boundary, and Mumbai are 88 for 3 in 11.1 overs. Hardik Pandya walks out to join Rohit Sharma, who's only faced 22 balls so far and scored 27 runs.
</p>
<p>The sixth over has just begun, and we're seeing pace for the first time in the form of Pat Cummins. This is only the second time that spinners have bowled uninterrupted through the first five overs of an IPL innings.

KKR were the bowling team on the first occasion as well, when Shakib Al Hasan, Sunil Narine and Piyush Chawla sent down the first five overs to the Super Kings in Ranchi back in 2014.

Shakib, who came on as first change today, has been involved in both instances.

This all-spin strategy hasn't hurt Mumbai unduly so far, though. They are 37 for 1 after five overs, and Suryakumar Yadav, who hit three fours off Harbhajan Singh in the third over, is looking in excellent touch.
